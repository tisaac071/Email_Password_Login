# Email_Password_Login
Email and Password Login Using Firebase auth.
Firstly, remember to add depenecies(implementation 'com.android.support:design:28+), or check for the latest depenencies:
->Create, configure and connect Firebase project(authentication) to your Android Studio Application(You can easily add using the tools provided). This will automatically add firebase-auth dependecies and JSON file to your project

->Log in to firebase and enable Firebase User Email Registration Authentication from Firebase Panel in Authentication section(am thinking you already have a firebase account and if not, create one)

->Go the android studio and open activities in this code
->Add internet permission
->Create the activities and follow the code provided and the comments
